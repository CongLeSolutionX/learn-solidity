# Message Calls

- Send value and `calldata` to contracts
- The first message call is the beginning of the transaction (EOA -> contract)
- Each subsequent message call is part of the same transaction (contract -> contract)
- The transaction and any state changes only complete when the initial function call finishes execution

## Message Call Breakdown

- As we saw message calls can contain `gas`, `value` and `calldata`
- These message values become available as globals in solidity:

  - `msg.sender` - who made the last message call
  - `msg.value` - amount in wei sent
  - `msg.data` - calldata
  - `msg.sig` - the function identifier

---

## How Do EOAs and Contracts Call Other Contracts?

- They use the `address` of the contract they want to communicate with
- This is a data type in solidity that is 20 bytes long
- The `msg.sender` from the previous slide is an address

---

## What does that look like?

```js
contract X {
  address deployer;
  address otherContract;

  constructor(address _otherContract) {
    deployer = msg.sender;
    otherContract = _otherContract;
  }
}
```

---

## Can any method call receive ether?

Only `payable` methods can:

```js
contract X {
  receive() external payable {
    // no calldata necessary here
    // just send a value on the message call
  }

  function pay() external payable {
    // in this case, we target pay with a value
  }
}
```

---

## What does sending value look like?

The `.call` syntax is `.call{ gas, value }(calldata)`

```js
contract X {
  address otherContract;

  constructor(address _otherContract) payable {
    otherContract = _otherContract;
    _otherContract.call{ value: msg.value }("");
  }
}
```

---

## Handle the success

The solidity compiler will warn you if you don't handle `success`

```js
contract X {
  address otherContract;

  constructor(address _otherContract) payable {
    otherContract = _otherContract;
    (bool success, ) = _otherContract.call{ value: msg.value }("");
    require(success);
  }
}
```

## Accounts ðŸ“«

In Ethereum, accounts are often distinguished into two types: **Externally Owned Accounts** and **Contract Accounts**. The differences between these accounts is largely conceptual as the EVM essentially treats them the same!

Every account on the EVM has a public address and a balance. Contract accounts will also store their bytecode as well as their internal storage data.

When making a call from an EOA to a Contract Account it's important to know things like who is making the call, how much ether they are sending and the function they are intending to invoke with which arguments.

The Solidity language handles the wiring up of the transaction data to the function we have defined on the contract. The language also gives us access to the transaction parameters through globals like `msg.sender` and `msg.value`.

By providing these utilities for working with accounts we can easily define roles, permissions and track token balances in contracts.
